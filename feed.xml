It’s also written terribly, I’m sorry.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="thoughts">thoughts</h2> <p><b></b></p> <p>To anyone reading this, this is not meant to be a sob story or an attempt to make people feel bad for me. I’m very grateful for my life and the people in it. I don’t even know why I’m posting this to be honest, another calling to the void…</p> <p>I’m currently in Seattle for the summer, a city known for depression and sadness because of the constant rain. I also spent last summer here because of an internship. Prior to interning, I had this hope of making a close knit group of friends for the summer, having the time of our lives. This “dream” is probably because of a few older friends I have who developed a close group of friends while interning.</p> <p>Simply put, I never had friends until college. Sure, I had one or two here and there (I’m not trying to disregard those friendships). I guess a better term is “friend group” but that’s also not the point I’m trying to make.</p> <p>Starting off with a few of my earliest memories, I only recall having one or two friends every year in elementary school. In the American education system, students in elementary school are assigned to a classroom for the year with the same group of students (~26). The following year, students would typically move up a grade and be reassigned teachers, thus causing classmates to change. I vividly recall numerous parent-teacher conferences where feedback from my teachers would always be that I’m very quiet.</p> <p>As a result, I mostly kept to myself and with the few friends I had, I would end up losing them to the new friends they made. I always dreaded recess because I never had friends to play with. During the earlier years, I played by myself at the play structure with the monkey bars. This transitioned to a brief wall-ball stint where I would later on walk aimlessly around the school yard. Eventually, I would hide at the very back of the school perimeter or walk to the farthest field and just sit in the grass. Thank goodness students were forced to sit with their class during lunch… In middle school, there was free seating though so I always sat at this table with an acquaintance (my stand partner from orchestra) who I guess took pity on me. I would just eat my lunch in silence while the people around me talked, then leave for the rest of that time.</p> <p>As someone who is quiet, I would people-watch often and all I ever wanted was a group of friends. It was always my biggest worry for large events such as field trips, promotion/graduation, or even just the break period before performing in a concert. With the few people I knew, they would converse with me but eventually, they would leave and go to their actual friends. In 8th grade, we had an overnight trip to Disneyland which was the highlight of orchestra/band but I was constantly worried about what group I’d be part of throughout the day when going on rides. I desperately envied a few friend groups who seemed extremely close, and was just afraid of appearing lonely. Thankfully, my cousin changed schools and joined mine in 7th grade. We grew up together so it was great having a familiar face nearby.</p> <p>I attended a very large high school (~830 students per grade level) and there were various “break” periods throughout the day. During brunch (15 min), I would rotate between:</p> <ol> <li>Going to the library and pretending to browse the books or quickly finish homework</li> <li>Going to the bathroom to pee/hide in the stall when I actually didn’t need to go</li> <li>Walk to my building, go to my locker, then pretend I’m searching or grabbing something in my locker when in actuality, it’s empty</li> </ol> <p>15 minutes is such a short amount of time but it was extremely dreaded for me. I absolutely hated going to my class building because everyone would be clustered around in their friend groups, but I had none to go to. I would arrive to school exactly on time to avoid having to spend time near peers waiting for school to start. I absolutely hated rainy days because everyone would be gathered in the buildings with their friends but I didn’t have a location to go to.</p> <p>During lunch, I would sit outside on the ground near a pillar and eat with my cousin. Honestly, I don’t know why she even chose to eat with me. She had more friends than me and an actual group to go to as well so I think she just felt pitiful of me. I’m appreciative of it throughout all the years though — I was really pathetic.</p> <p>An unpopular opinion but I was appreciative of COVID-19 though because it took away a lot of my worries regarding friendships. All of the senior events that were canceled now left me less stressed since I didn’t have to worry about being friendless. With college, I wanted to change myself and actually make friends. During orientation, I went out of my comfort zone to attend events and converse with people, but I never vibed with anybody except for two people who probably invited me because we were females in STEM.</p> <p>In retrospect, I don’t think I realized how lonely I was in elementary school until probably fifth grade. <em>I thought I was pretty normal so what was wrong with me?</em> Yeah, I know I’m introverted but this was a little strange, especially after changing myself in college. The loneliness in college is fine for the most part — everyone is so busy and schedules are so different that it’s hard to meet up. I’ve also found clubs where I’ve gratefully made friends from.</p> <p>I’ve always had these worries and fears about myself but they came to life in Summer 2023 when I was generally alone. My internship was my first “real” job but my team was fully remote, so I had no one to eat lunch with. Additionally, the people on my floor became friends earlier than I did because I had to fly back home for several graduations during the first two weekends, leaving them to be more closely bonded. As a result, I wasn’t part of their friend group and ended up eating lunch alone (genuinely every day) by hiding in one of the nooks.</p> <p>Luckily, one of my Berkeley friends was in Seattle and she made two other friends during tech setup. So in total, I had three other friends throughout the entirety of summer. I’m extremely grateful for them since we had similar interests (ex: hiking) but in the grand scheme, Amazon had about 9,000-15,000 interns in the Seattle area alone, and I was only able to become friends with two of them? And they weren’t even people I met by myself, they were through my Berkeley friend. What was so offputting about me?</p> <p>With all of the time I had by myself, I ended up spending a lot of time thinking about myself, my life, and the world. That’s another topic maybe for later but I cried a lot these past two summers which is a lot for me.</p> <p>This summer at work, I’m privileged enough where most meals are provided by the office so most interns eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner there. However, my manager is full-time remote and my mentors were gone for the first couple of weeks, leaving me alone for the majority of the work day. It’s not that bad, but the other interns around me were constantly included in their team and I just felt very alone. <em>Why couldn’t I get the same experience they did?</em></p> <p>To this date (starting Week 5/12), I have yet to eat lunch or dinner with the other interns. I’m sure they’d be okay with me joining them, but it feels a little weird since I’m just butting into their group. Nobody has ever reached out to eat with me and it just makes me think about whether my existence matters or not. I know I’m being dramatic but it’s a thought that constantly circles in my head. I’m fairly certain that if I ended up dying, no one would know about it until at least a week later and nobody would be affected by it except for a few select people (my parents).</p> <p><em>Oh, why not just be the person who invites others to do activities with you?</em> I think that because it’s so rare that I get invited to anything, <em>why would anyone want to hang out with me?</em> To cope with this, I’ve adjusted with doing activities by myself which I enjoy, but it does get lonely and a bit embarrassing that everyone is with at least another person while I’m just by myself. And for some activities like hiking, it’s really hard to conduct solo (and unsafe) but hopefully when I go hiking alone, I’ll get lost with my phone dead, unreachable.</p> <p>This has just become a ramble but all in all, I’ve just felt extremely lonely over the past few weeks more than usual. There’s nothing that can be done to change this so I’ve just accepted the fact that I’ll be doing things independently like I’ve always done for the rest of my time in Seattle and beyond.</p> <p>I’ve been told by many Berkeley people that I’m a really good friend. It’s not intentional but I guess it’s because I have so few that I truly treasure the ones I have. People might appear to be okay on the outside but that’s not always the case — the thoughts are consuming.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="posts"/><category term="opinions"/><category term="reflections"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[too much time alone]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">things i wish i knew before visiting japan</title><link href="https://christyquang.github.io/blog/2024/things-i-wish-i-knew-before-visiting-japan/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="things i wish i knew before visiting japan"/><published>2024-05-26T15:59:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-26T15:59:00+00:00</updated><id>https://christyquang.github.io/blog/2024/things-i-wish-i-knew-before-visiting-japan</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://christyquang.github.io/blog/2024/things-i-wish-i-knew-before-visiting-japan/"><![CDATA[<p><strong>[May 14, 2024]</strong> I’m currently in Japan while I’m drafting this post, unable to sleep because I randomly woke up at 2:30 AM and decided to work on this. This was my first time visiting Japan and the first international trip I’ve taken as a <em>competent</em> human being (aka not a kid). These are the things I wish I knew to make the travel process more seamless and the trip more fun — please don’t suffer like I did.</p> <p><strong>[May 26, 2024]</strong> I was bored and don’t have friends in Seattle so here I am, writing random nonsense to the void.</p> <hr/> <h3 id="my-itinerary">My Itinerary</h3> <p>My dad randomly called me one day in the middle of April saying that he needed to verify some information for filing my taxes, then ended up convincing me to take a week long trip to Japan immediately after my last final until the start of my internship. I truly have never been as stressed as I was during that time period but here are the trip specifications and distance covered:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Length:</strong> 5/11/2024 - 5/18/2024 <ul> <li>Stayed in Tokyo (1 night), Osaka (4 nights), Shinjuku City (1 night)</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>5/11:</strong> Flight</li> <li><strong>5/12:</strong> Narita Airport –&gt; Tokyo</li> <li><strong>5/13:</strong> Osaka</li> <li><strong>5/14:</strong> Kyoto</li> <li><strong>5/15:</strong> Kyoto</li> <li><strong>5/16:</strong> Nara</li> <li><strong>5/17:</strong> Shinjuku City</li> <li><strong>5/18:</strong> Shinjuku City –&gt; Narita Airport, flight</li> </ul> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="prior-to-trip">Prior to Trip</h3> <ul> <li>Make sure your cards are usable abroad.</li> <li>Add the transit cards (Suica, PASMOS, ICOCA) to your Apple Wallet (if you have an Apple device). <ul> <li>Click the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> sign to add a card</li> <li>Click <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Transit Card</code></li> <li>Under the “Japan” section, click your preferred option (I used Suica)</li> <li>Adding money is through the cards on your Apple Wallet <ul> <li>Make sure you have a Mastercard on there</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Plan your trip in advance, especially places that are a “must-visit”. <ul> <li>Make reservations for popular restaurants</li> </ul> </li> <li>ZipAir <ul> <li>Read the fine details regarding baggage weights</li> <li>Bring your own food on the flight (it doesn’t add to your carry-on weight)</li> <li>Have activities ready for the flight (ex: download movies) because there isn’t an entertainment system provided</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Since you’re in a foreign country, make sure that you’ll be able to use your cards. Call the bank beforehand and ask them to not block your cards because otherwise, the detectors think there’s a fraud and then you won’t be able to use your cards.</p> <p>On your Apple Wallet, make sure that you have a Mastercard on there. Those cards are guaranteed to work to add money to your transportation cards whereas only some Visa cards have proven to work.</p> <blockquote> <p>The transit systems cards in Japan (Suica/PASMOS/ICOCA) are used to pay for the subway stations and buses. Generally, it’s a physical card but there’s an IC chip shortage so they aren’t giving them out to visitors as much (a “Welcome Suica Card” exists but isn’t easily available anymore). The card can also be used for purchases too at some stores (in my experience, mainly convenience stores). Get this card instead of buying paper tickets for every ride.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND</strong> planning the majority of your trip in advance, especially factoring in transportation.</p> <ul> <li>What cities do you want to visit? <ul> <li>Book hotels at strategic locations (ex: live in Osaka if you want to visit Kyoto and Nara)</li> </ul> </li> <li>What activities do you want to do/visit? What places do you want to eat at?</li> </ul> <p>I didn’t plan any of our itinerary until the night before each day so it was really tiring. Additionally, the lack of planning left us unable to see all the places we wanted to visit or try popular restaurants (most require a reservation). Navigating through the public transit system was also a struggle because it’s hard to initially get a grasp of due to the magnitude and language barrier.</p> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="getting-from-narita-airport-to-tokyo-and-back">Getting from Narita Airport to Tokyo (and back)</h3> <p>All I knew before arriving in Japan was that it’d take a little over an hour to get from the Narita Airport to our hotel in Tokyo. However, I was clueless and didn’t think to even consider how to pay for that transportation, let alone what specific type of transportation it would be.</p> <p><u>What I Did:</u></p> <p>After getting our Suica cards set up, we took the train to Tokyo (I think it was the Narita Express) but we just tapped through the scanners and didn’t buy physical paper tickets. We sat at a random section which ended up being the “Reserved Seats” section — this area is checked by the train workers who told us to move to another section (so embarrassing).</p> <p><u>What I Recommend You Do:</u></p> <ul> <li>Search for the most convenient option available (Narita Express tended to be on the more expensive side) <ul> <li>If you have the time and more familarity with the transit system, take the regular subway</li> <li>Narita Express is the most direct option</li> </ul> </li> <li>Narita Express: Each train is split into reserved seating (more expensive) vs. non-reserved seating <ul> <li>Non-reserved seating is at the back of the train, usually cars 1-5</li> <li>It’ll say on the train car and signs which car is reserved seating or not</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>When traveling back to the airport, I decided to take the regular subway system will ended up taking FOREVER for some strange reason (literally took us a little over 3 hours to get from Tokyo to Narita Airport). It was quite traumatic and stressful because we almost missed our flight.</p> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="getting-from-tokyo-to-osaka-and-back">Getting from Tokyo to Osaka (and back)</h3> <p>Traveling from Tokyo to the Osaka area is fairly common and the easiest way is by taking a bullet train (Shinkansen). The ride is a little over 3 hours which is extremely fast considering the amount of miles covered. The train is comfortable and there are bathrooms onboard, as well as (adequate) Wi-Fi.</p> <p>To ride on this train:</p> <ul> <li>Wait in the really long line to get physical tickets with an attendant <ul> <li>Mobile Suica cards don’t work at the machines because those only accept physical cards</li> </ul> </li> <li>Payment can be through your physical cards like Visa (not Suica)</li> <li>You’ll receive a physical ticket that you’ll insert through the gate (which will be ejected out) in addition to tapping your Suica card against the scanner</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>DO NOT lose your physical ticket. If you do, you’ll need to pay the cost of that ticket again (~$94).</p> </blockquote> <p>I lost my physical ticket near my seat and talked to an attendant at the counter. The company’s policy is that everyone has to pay the original cost on top of what was previously paid if the workers at both train stations are unable to find your physical ticket.</p> <p>Travelers have the option to pay for “reserved” (more expensive but guaranteed seats) or “non-reserved” seating. Make sure to pay attention to which train cars are for “non-reserved” seating — typically cars 1-5 at the back.</p> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="cities-visited">Cities Visited</h3> <p>Here are my reviews and reflections for the cities I visited, attractions I saw, and restaurants/food I ate.

When going to the station, it had started raining as we were lugging our suitcases across the streets. A big culture shock was seeing how EVERYONE uses umbrellas, even for the slightest bit of rain. We got a bunch of side-eyes since we didn’t bring umbrellas and didn’t want to purchase one.</p> <p>The bullet train was a bit of a struggle and after arriving at Shin-Osaka Station, we were famished and chose a random restaurant to eat at. I forgot the name of it but we all ordered this collagen chicken noodle soup. I’m pretty sure my parents got rizzed up by the word “collagen”. The noodle soup was actually delicious but the bowl was TINY and it was so expensive. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rating: 6/10</code></p> <p>The jiggly Japanese cheesecake has grown significantly in popularity so it was a must-try for me, especially since my mom loves cheesecake. We had purchased a small cheesecake pastry from 7-11 the day prior and consumed it on the bullet train — it was DELICIOUS. Rikuro’s Namba Main Branch had a huge line outside of it but the wait was very short. The cheesecake was pretty cheap ($8-9) and tasted good, though the 7-11 one might be tastier… My picture is quite disappointing though because the heat and condensation from the box made the top of the cheesecake flaccid, but luckily it was still a little bit jiggly! <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rating: 8.5/10</code></p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blogs/japan/shinosakafood.JPG-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blogs/japan/shinosakafood.JPG-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blogs/japan/shinosakafood.JPG-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/blogs/japan/shinosakafood.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blogs/japan/cheesecake.JPG-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blogs/japan/cheesecake.JPG-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blogs/japan/cheesecake.JPG-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/blogs/japan/cheesecake.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>We had some difficulty finding our hotel because I was directionally challenged and navigated us to the wrong hotel with a very similar name.

I’ve attempted making Japanese soufflé pancakes at home which were somewhat of a success, but these were the professional ones that I needed to try.

Maruyama Park was quite big and we spent a lot of time there because my mom was tired and I needed to find a restaurant to go to for dinner.</p> <p>Gyukatsu Kyoto Katsugyu kept popping up and since my parents have never really tried chicken katsu before, we decided to go there. Turns out, this wasn’t a chicken katsu place but was instead a wagyu katsu restaurant. My parents hate raw meat so they were really worried but there ended up being a tiny stove where you can cook your meat prior to eating it.

The main priority on the agenda was getting hair cuts since that was what my mom wanted to do the most. I had previously searched online for hair salons and almost all had a reservation/appointment system.</p> <p>Turns out, hair salons prefer customers to schedule appointments (even if it’s an hour before). We had walked into a salon and they were fully booked, so I found another salon called “youres hair 新宿WEST店”. I hastily made appointments for my mother and I literally an hour before our actual slots.</p> <p>This was the first time I had professional hair treatment in a salon, in addition to dyeing my hair (rip to my hair virginity). Typically, my mom made my aunt or random acquaintances cut my hair on an old and smelly porch in my uncle’s backyard. I had quite the opposite experience since the salon itself was very clean and sophisticated. My hair was EXTREMELY long since I hadn’t had a haircut for over a year.</p> <p>Due to the language barrier, I communicated with my hair stylist via Google Translate which honestly wasn’t too bad. Since I was so inexperienced in the hair world, I literally didn’t understand some of the phrases he was using and told him to just “do whatever you think is best”.</p> <p>We had shown up so late in the afternoon (~5 PM) so he informed me that I wouldn’t be able to get highlights or bleach my hair. I ended up coloring my hair to a darker brown in addition to a hair cut.</p> <p>First, I got my hair slightly wet for the coloring process. Afterwards, he applied the dye onto my hair and I ended up looking like a seran wrap conehead. I had to wait a bit for the dye to color my hair and the salon provided tablets with Amazon Prime and drinks (tea) for their customers to consume. I played some fruit game on my Huawei tablet :D.</p> <p>Once the dye settled onto my hair, my stylist washed my hair and massaged my hair which was a nice experience — I almost fell asleep. My initial reaction after seeing my colored hair was that I looked weird. He trimmed my hair but I had to tell him a few times that I wanted to chop off a bunch of inches because I was paying so much money for this. He gave me surface layers and curled my hair at the end.</p> <p>I thought I looked REALLY WEIRD but my parents told me it looked good. In the meantime, my mom got a hair cut and perm which looked great on her. My dad was just happy because there was Wi-Fi while he was waiting for 2+ hours.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blogs/japan/reaction-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blogs/japan/reaction-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blogs/japan/reaction-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/blogs/japan/reaction.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> My sister's reaction to my hair </div> </div> <p>Since the hair appointments took so long, we only had time for dinner.

That was literally the only thing my dad kept raving about — how delicious that milk was. We went to four different 7-11’s and unfortunately exited empty-handed. Perhaps, that milk carton is only available in Tokyo(?) or maybe it is so scrumptious that it sells out quickly…</p> <p>We had planned on spending our last day shopping but the hair appointment took so long that most stores were closed by then. As such, I planned on allocating 1.5 hours to shop before taking the subway to the airport. What a terrible idea…</p> <p>We briefly shopped at a Daiso but I literally could not locate the LOFT store in a mall. That wasted about 20 minutes and by then, it was nearing too close to the time we should depart for the airport. I decided to just navigate us to the airport but the station in Shinjuku City was especially confusing and for some reason, all of the subways we traveled on had random transfers/stops. The ride to the airport took almost four hours when it should have taken a little over one hour…</p> <p>In addition, ZipAir requires passengers to arrive one hour before departure at the latest and we were really close to that deadline. As we were rushing, my mom fell too ;-;</p> <p>All in all, that train ride was extremely stressful because if I had missed my flight, I wouldn’t be able to go to Seattle the next day since ZipAir flights only operate once a day.</p> <p>Once we arrived at our gate, we wanted to use up the remaining coins we had at an ice cream vending machine. The ice cream bar depicted below was the most expensive one purchased whilst also being the smallest. I shared the bar with my parents since it was the last one but I had completely forgotten that my dad was sick. As a result, I got a sore throat on the flight and ended up falling extremely ill after the flight (in fact, I’m still sick more than a week later as I’m writing this).</p> <p>During takeoff, I noticed that the plane’s wing was a little suspicious and unstable. I’m no expert on aircraft but that doesn’t look very safe… perks of choosing cheap flights! Usually, I welcome death but I had never feared my death as much as I did on that flight because I didn’t want my parents to pass away.</p> <p>I had read on Reddit that the 7-11 egg salad sandwiches were delicious so obviously, I had to try one myself. I bought one for the flight back but unfortunately, it got squished.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blogs/japan/icecreambar.JPG-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blogs/japan/icecreambar.JPG-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blogs/japan/icecreambar.JPG-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/blogs/japan/icecreambar.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blogs/japan/susplane-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blogs/japan/susplane-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blogs/japan/susplane-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/blogs/japan/susplane.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blogs/japan/eggsalad.JPG-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blogs/japan/eggsalad.JPG-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blogs/japan/eggsalad.JPG-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/blogs/japan/eggsalad.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>During the flight to Japan, I watched “The Idea of You” which is a horrible choice when you’re sitting next to your parents. On the flight back, I watched “Barbie” which made me fall asleep two times. <em>slayyyy</em> 💅</p> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3> <ol> <li>The public transportation system there is SO GOOD but also simultaneously so overwhelming.</li> <li>Everything in Japan is so cheap compared to the USA. Travel LIGHT, you’ll want to buy stuff (in fact, do because the yen has depreciated so much).</li> <li>Food is infinitely better in Japan. 7/11 is FANTASTIC.</li> <li>Society is kind of “old” but technology (especially transportation) is strangely advanced?</li> <li>Why are there SO MANY PEOPLE at the subway stations and everywhere in general? Where did they spawn from…</li> <li>People use umbrellas for the smallest amounts of rain. I’m from California where people freak out over rain and even I think the umbrella usage is ridiculous — it was literally for DRIZZLE.</li> <li>Enter the bus through the middle without paying but when leaving, exit through the front entrance after paying via tapping your Suica card.</li> <li>Japan is not very accessibility-friendly. Lugging suitcases across flights of stairs is terrible.</li> </ol> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="tldr">TLDR</h3> <p>Traveling with parents is difficult and don’t go on a vacation that you haven’t planned for right after finals and before another trip. Also, don’t share food with sick people (but the food is FIRE there).</p> <p>Japan has a bit of a … stain in my perspective so I’ll be needing some time away from this country. It’s not them, it’s me.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="posts"/><category term="travel"/><category term="advice"/><category term="opinions"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[essentials you should know as a first time visitor to japan]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">why blog?</title><link href="https://christyquang.github.io/blog/2024/why-blog/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="why blog?"/><published>2024-05-12T12:24:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-12T12:24:00+00:00</updated><id>https://christyquang.github.io/blog/2024/why-blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://christyquang.github.io/blog/2024/why-blog/"><![CDATA[<p><b></b></p> <p>👋 Hello stranger reading this! I’m not sure why you’re here but this post explains why I want to blog.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="so-why">so why?</h2> <p><b></b></p> <p>A lot of people have told me that I’m a really quiet person and that they want to get to know me better. I’ve also been informed that people want to know what’s going on in my head. Truth be told, I’m usually “no thoughts, head empty”. I tend to not overthink things and mainly live (mostly) in the present because life is so unpredictable, something might happen to flip my world upside down so why bother planning every detail?</p> <p>When attempting to make my personal website years ago, I looked at a bunch of other websites for <em>inspiration</em> and I liked the aspect of having a blog/forum of my own opinions and thoughts. I found that section of those sites extremely appealing to read through since it was a way to get to know those people better. Specifically, UC Berkeley’s <a href="https://cs161.org">CS 161</a> course has a <a href="https://pedagogy.cs161.org/">pedagogy blog</a> that I found <strong>especially</strong> fascinating and thought-provoking. Thus, I wanted a persistent means of sharing my advice or opinions online.</p> <p>Personally, I don’t think anyone will read any of my posts because I’m boring but for a long time, I wanted to share a couple of my opinions and have a “diary” of some sort to see how my thinking has changed and/or transitioned over time. I love data and recording miniscule details so this is another means for that.</p> <p>Medium is another blog forum site which I’ve used before but there are article reading restrictions on that platform, in addition to me not wanting people to get notified when I post which is why I’m choosing to post on my own site.</p> <p>These opinions will be only affiliated with me and (probably) not edited or proof-read thoroughly, it’s just a method of me to thought dump and reflect as my life progresses. In actuality, it’s probably just me wasting my time by procrastinating. Hopefully I’ll be able to post semi-frequently during any downtime I have but we’ll see… 🤡</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="posts"/><category term="random"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[this post explains why I created a blog]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">KDr-awe-ma Opinions &amp;amp; Recommendations</title><link href="https://christyquang.github.io/blog/2021/kdrama/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="KDr-awe-ma Opinions &amp;amp; Recommendations"/><published>2021-12-09T12:24:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-09T12:24:00+00:00</updated><id>https://christyquang.github.io/blog/2021/kdrama</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://christyquang.github.io/blog/2021/kdrama/"><![CDATA[<p><b></b></p> <p>I’m too lazy to copy over my original blog post to here so if you want to read it, please click the link below.
