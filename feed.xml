It shocked me when I found out that most colleges have only a couple of libraries. If you met me in college, you probably associate rotting in libraries with me since I probably go to a library at least once a day. Surprisingly enough, I never really went to the library to get work done prior to college (which in hindight also makes sense since the libraries were a bit further away from my house and I had no mode of transportation).</p> <p>I enjoy working in libraries because I‚Äôm able to focus in a location where others are working as well. I call this ‚Äúpeer pressure‚Äù, where knowing the presence of others hard at work motivates me to be productive as well. Additionally, my apartment is further away from campus so it‚Äôs unideal for me to go back and forth from different locations when working, hence why I just go to a library.</p> <p>As such, my goal is to work in all of the accessible libraries at UC Berkeley by the time I graduate and to provide my opinion on all of them for anyone interested. The number of libraries vary but according to this <a href="https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/about/news/library-101">article</a>, there are 20 libraries (though not all are accessible for undergraduate students). I‚Äôll be ranking them by the criteria below with a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best) with additional comments underneath (ex: needing to show Cal-ID). It‚Äôs difficult to rank which libraries I like best so I‚Äôll notate my preferences on which ones to go to for certain needs.</p> <ul> <li>Ability to eat</li> <li>Ability to find an outlet</li> <li>Ability to find a seat</li> <li>Crowdedness</li> <li>Noise level</li> <li>Accessibility (duration of being open)</li> </ul> <p><br/></p> <h4 id="bancroft-library">Bancroft Library</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Eat:</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">False</code> <ul> <li>If you‚Äôre quiet enough and there aren‚Äôt as many ppl, yes</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Outlets:</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3/5</code> <ul> <li>Desks usually have one</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Seating:</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3/5</code> <ul> <li>Generally spots available</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Crowdedness:</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2.5/5</code> <ul> <li>One of the bigger libraries so there tends to be people throughout the day and visitors throughout VLSB because of cool science artifacts/posters scattered throughout the building (like a dinosaur skeleton outside the library entrance)</li> <li>Busy during exam season</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Noise:</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3.5/5</code> <ul> <li>Large and tall building so it‚Äôs kind of echoey but people are quiet</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4/5</code> <ul> <li>Opens early and closes around 9 PM throughout weekdays and weekends</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Comments</strong> <ul> <li>Don‚Äôt need Cal-ID to enter</li> <li>Kind of confusing to first navigate since it‚Äôs connected to Doe Library, Main Stacks, and Moffitt</li> <li>Beautiful architecture</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><br/></p> <h4 id="berkeley-law-library">Berkeley Law Library</h4> <ul> <li>TBA</li> </ul> <p><br/></p> <h4 id="bioscience-natural-resources--public-health-vlsb">Bioscience, Natural Resources &amp;

As a Warriors fan, I‚Äôm obligated to dislike his father, Lebron James. I definitely am not a fan of him but I respect his impact on the game of basketball and his dedication to positively impact whatever team he‚Äôs on. The main reason why I dislike Lebron is because of his cockiness and ego ‚Äî like yes, he‚Äôs a good basketball player but I think it‚Äôs very egotistical of him to deem himself ‚ÄúThe King‚Äù when there are loads of great basketball players throughout history.</p> <p>To be fair, I haven‚Äôt watched Bronny play too much except for the occasional highlight post/reel that pops up on my Instagram feed. However, I‚Äôve never been impressed by any of his highlights (I think one of his highlights during his first NBA summer league game was an easy steal and pass üíÄ).</p> <p>He was selected 55th overall in the second round of the NBA 2024 draft. Did he deserve to be drafted? No, and here are my reasons and thoughts circulating him.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>What are the odds that he gets drafted AND to the Lakers, the same team his father is on?</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Bronny is barely 6‚Äô2‚Äù. That‚Äôs considered extremely short in the NBA. In Stephen Curry‚Äôs scouting report, coaches said that he‚Äôd be unlikely to find success in the league because of his height, mind you Curry is 6‚Äô3‚Äù. The fact that the Lakers ended up drafting him is extremely suspicious to me‚Ä¶ the nepotism at hand is <strong>CRAZY</strong>.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Bronny was not the star player at USC.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>During the 25 games he played during his freshman season (typically 35-40 games per season), he only averaged 4.8 points per game. He also only started in six of those games. Usually, a player can make up for less PPG by contributing to other stats like rebounds or assists but he only averaged 2.8 rebounds and 2.1 assists. <em>Numbers don‚Äôt lie‚Ä¶</em></p> <blockquote> <p><strong>He had a cardiac arrest, he deserves some slack.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Yes, it‚Äôs unfortunate that incident happened to him. However, it‚Äôs a bit suspicious to me because Bronny is young, incredibly fit, and healthy with access to the best trainers and doctors available. The timing of his cardiac arrest was also strange since it was right before the start of the college season and there were no instances of heart failure in the past. I‚Äôm aware that heart problems do randomly occur for some people but these are just some factors I‚Äôm wary about. <em>Was this a planned accident to get the media less focused on his success in the upcoming season and draft? Who knows‚Ä¶</em></p> <blockquote> <p><strong>How did he go from being hesitant on staying at USC/playing in college basketball to enrolling in the NBA draft?</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>For any other NBA prospect, there is absolutely NO WAY they would get drafted with Bronny‚Äôs stats and caliber. He was considering transferring colleges but then somehow made it to the draft? Additionally, rookies are rarely paid millions when drafted but he signed a $7.9 million contract across 4 years. <strong>HE HAS NEVER EVEN PLAYED FOR THEM YET</strong>, he has proved none of his skills to the team yet. He has definitely improved leading up to the draft combine but still not up to par to other players. Yes, his jersey and position on the team will bring in lots of revenue which the NBA ultimately is, a business, but please‚Ä¶</p> <p>All in all, I think it‚Äôs incredibly unfair that Bronny was drafted when there were so many other players who have equally worked as hard (arguably less) to get to that position as he did. At the same time, I feel bad for Bronny because he has an immense amount of pressure on him, being the firstborn son of ‚ÄúThe King‚Äù. I kind of feel bad for him because he‚Äôs getting more scrutinized than others but at the same time, he was cocky enough to only accept workouts from 3 teams‚Ä¶ I wish him the best in his career, with such a low bar he‚Äôs setting, he‚Äôs sure to beat the odds.</p> <p>Ironically enough, he already got injured after one game. I feel like most of this is Lebron‚Äôs doing since he‚Äôs a stats-chaser and wants them to be the first active father-son duo in the NBA but I don‚Äôt know ‚Äî <em>doesn‚Äôt it feel unsettling knowing that what you achieved wasn‚Äôt rightfully deserved?</em> But then again, money can buy happiness, or in this case, a career lol.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="posts"/><category term="opinions"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[my perspective on lebron james jr]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">thoughts</title><link href="https://christyquang.github.io/blog/2024/thoughts/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="thoughts"/><published>2024-06-15T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-15T12:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://christyquang.github.io/blog/2024/thoughts</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://christyquang.github.io/blog/2024/thoughts/"><![CDATA[<p><b></b></p> <p>I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm posting this to the Internet - I hope no one reads this. It‚Äôs also written terribly, I‚Äôm sorry.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="thoughts">thoughts</h2> <p><b></b></p> <p>To anyone reading this, this is not meant to be a sob story or an attempt to make people feel bad for me. I‚Äôm very grateful for my life and the people in it. I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm posting this to be honest, another calling to the void‚Ä¶</p> <p>I‚Äôm currently in Seattle for the summer, a city known for depression and sadness because of the constant rain. I also spent last summer here because of an internship. Prior to interning, I had this hope of making a close knit group of friends for the summer, having the time of our lives. This ‚Äúdream‚Äù is probably because of a few older friends I have who developed a close group of friends while interning.</p> <p>Simply put, I never had friends until college. Sure, I had one or two here and there (I‚Äôm not trying to disregard those friendships). I guess a better term is ‚Äúfriend group‚Äù but that‚Äôs also not the point I‚Äôm trying to make.</p> <p>Starting off with a few of my earliest memories, I only recall having one or two friends every year in elementary school. In the American education system, students in elementary school are assigned to a classroom for the year with the same group of students (~26). The following year, students would typically move up a grade and be reassigned teachers, thus causing classmates to change. I vividly recall numerous parent-teacher conferences where feedback from my teachers would always be that I‚Äôm very quiet.</p> <p>As a result, I mostly kept to myself and with the few friends I had, I would end up losing them to the new friends they made. I always dreaded recess because I never had friends to play with. During the earlier years, I played by myself at the play structure with the monkey bars. This transitioned to a brief wall-ball stint where I would later on walk aimlessly around the school yard. Eventually, I would hide at the very back of the school perimeter or walk to the farthest field and just sit in the grass. Thank goodness students were forced to sit with their class during lunch‚Ä¶ In middle school, there was free seating though so I always sat at this table with an acquaintance (my stand partner from orchestra) who I guess took pity on me. I would just eat my lunch in silence while the people around me talked, then leave for the rest of that time.</p> <p>As someone who is quiet, I would people-watch often and all I ever wanted was a group of friends. It was always my biggest worry for large events such as field trips, promotion/graduation, or even just the break period before performing in a concert. With the few people I knew, they would converse with me but eventually, they would leave and go to their actual friends. In 8th grade, we had an overnight trip to Disneyland which was the highlight of orchestra/band but I was constantly worried about what group I‚Äôd be part of throughout the day when going on rides. I desperately envied a few friend groups who seemed extremely close, and was just afraid of appearing lonely. Thankfully, my cousin changed schools and joined mine in 7th grade. We grew up together so it was great having a familiar face nearby.</p> <p>I attended a very large high school (~830 students per grade level) and there were various ‚Äúbreak‚Äù periods throughout the day. During brunch (15 min), I would rotate between:</p> <ol> <li>Going to the library and pretending to browse the books or quickly finish homework</li> <li>Going to the bathroom to pee/hide in the stall when I actually didn‚Äôt need to go</li> <li>Walk to my building, go to my locker, then pretend I‚Äôm searching or grabbing something in my locker when in actuality, it‚Äôs empty</li> </ol> <p>15 minutes is such a short amount of time but it was extremely dreaded for me. I absolutely hated going to my class building because everyone would be clustered around in their friend groups, but I had none to go to. I would arrive to school exactly on time to avoid having to spend time near peers waiting for school to start. I absolutely hated rainy days because everyone would be gathered in the buildings with their friends but I didn‚Äôt have a location to go to.</p> <p>During lunch, I would sit outside on the ground near a pillar and eat with my cousin. Honestly, I don‚Äôt know why she even chose to eat with me. She had more friends than me and an actual group to go to as well so I think she just felt pitiful of me. I‚Äôm appreciative of it throughout all the years though ‚Äî I was really pathetic.</p> <p>An unpopular opinion but I was appreciative of COVID-19 though because it took away a lot of my worries regarding friendships. All of the senior events that were canceled now left me less stressed since I didn‚Äôt have to worry about being friendless. With college, I wanted to change myself and actually make friends. During orientation, I went out of my comfort zone to attend events and converse with people, but I never vibed with anybody except for two people who probably invited me because we were females in STEM.</p> <p>In retrospect, I don‚Äôt think I realized how lonely I was in elementary school until probably fifth grade. <em>I thought I was pretty normal so what was wrong with me?</em> Yeah, I know I‚Äôm introverted but this was a little strange, especially after changing myself in college. The loneliness in college is fine for the most part ‚Äî everyone is so busy and schedules are so different that it‚Äôs hard to meet up. I‚Äôve also found clubs where I‚Äôve gratefully made friends from.</p> <p>I‚Äôve always had these worries and fears about myself but they came to life in Summer 2023 when I was generally alone. My internship was my first ‚Äúreal‚Äù job but my team was fully remote, so I had no one to eat lunch with. Additionally, the people on my floor became friends earlier than I did because I had to fly back home for several graduations during the first two weekends, leaving them to be more closely bonded. As a result, I wasn‚Äôt part of their friend group and ended up eating lunch alone (genuinely every day) by hiding in one of the nooks.</p> <p>Luckily, one of my Berkeley friends was in Seattle and she made two other friends during tech setup. So in total, I had three other friends throughout the entirety of summer. I‚Äôm extremely grateful for them since we had similar interests (ex: hiking) but in the grand scheme, Amazon had about 9,000-15,000 interns in the Seattle area alone, and I was only able to become friends with two of them? And they weren‚Äôt even people I met by myself, they were through my Berkeley friend. What was so offputting about me?</p> <p>With all of the time I had by myself, I ended up spending a lot of time thinking about myself, my life, and the world. That‚Äôs another topic maybe for later but I cried a lot these past two summers which is a lot for me.</p> <p>This summer at work, I‚Äôm privileged enough where most meals are provided by the office so most interns eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner there. However, my manager is full-time remote and my mentors were gone for the first couple of weeks, leaving me alone for the majority of the work day. It‚Äôs not that bad, but the other interns around me were constantly included in their team and I just felt very alone. <em>Why couldn‚Äôt I get the same experience they did?</em></p> <p>To this date (starting Week 5/12), I have yet to eat lunch or dinner with the other interns. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd be okay with me joining them, but it feels a little weird since I‚Äôm just butting into their group. Nobody has ever reached out to eat with me and it just makes me think about whether my existence matters or not. I know I‚Äôm being dramatic but it‚Äôs a thought that constantly circles in my head. I‚Äôm fairly certain that if I ended up dying, no one would know about it until at least a week later and nobody would be affected by it except for a few select people (my parents).</p> <p><em>Oh, why not just be the person who invites others to do activities with you?</em> I think that because it‚Äôs so rare that I get invited to anything, <em>why would anyone want to hang out with me?</em> To cope with this, I‚Äôve adjusted with doing activities by myself which I enjoy, but it does get lonely and a bit embarrassing that everyone is with at least another person while I‚Äôm just by myself. And for some activities like hiking, it‚Äôs really hard to conduct solo (and unsafe) but hopefully when I go hiking alone, I‚Äôll get lost with my phone dead, unreachable.</p> <p>This has just become a ramble but all in all, I‚Äôve just felt extremely lonely over the past few weeks more than usual. There‚Äôs nothing that can be done to change this so I‚Äôve just accepted the fact that I‚Äôll be doing things independently like I‚Äôve always done for the rest of my time in Seattle and beyond.</p> <p>I‚Äôve been told by many Berkeley people that I‚Äôm a really good friend. It‚Äôs not intentional but I guess it‚Äôs because I have so few that I truly treasure the ones I have. People might appear to be okay on the outside but that‚Äôs not always the case ‚Äî the thoughts are consuming.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="posts"/><category term="opinions"/><category term="reflections"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[too much time alone]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">things i wish i knew before visiting japan</title><link href="https://christyquang.github.io/blog/2024/things-i-wish-i-knew-before-visiting-japan/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="things i wish i knew before visiting japan"/><published>2024-05-26T15:59:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-26T15:59:00+00:00</updated><id>https://christyquang.github.io/blog/2024/things-i-wish-i-knew-before-visiting-japan</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://christyquang.github.io/blog/2024/things-i-wish-i-knew-before-visiting-japan/"><![CDATA[<p><strong>[May 14, 2024]</strong> I‚Äôm currently in Japan while I‚Äôm drafting this post, unable to sleep because I randomly woke up at 2:30 AM and decided to work on this. This was my first time visiting Japan and the first international trip I‚Äôve taken as a <em>competent</em> human being (aka not a kid). These are the things I wish I knew to make the travel process more seamless and the trip more fun ‚Äî please don‚Äôt suffer like I did.</p> <p><strong>[May 26, 2024]</strong> I was bored and don‚Äôt have friends in Seattle so here I am, writing random nonsense to the void.</p> <hr/> <h3 id="my-itinerary">My Itinerary</h3> <p>My dad randomly called me one day in the middle of April saying that he needed to verify some information for filing my taxes, then ended up convincing me to take a week long trip to Japan immediately after my last final until the start of my internship. I truly have never been as stressed as I was during that time period but here are the trip specifications and distance covered:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Length:</strong> 5/11/2024 - 5/18/2024 <ul> <li>Stayed in Tokyo (1 night), Osaka (4 nights), Shinjuku City (1 night)</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>5/11:</strong> Flight</li> <li><strong>5/12:</strong> Narita Airport ‚Äì&gt; Tokyo</li> <li><strong>5/13:</strong> Osaka</li> <li><strong>5/14:</strong> Kyoto</li> <li><strong>5/15:</strong> Kyoto</li> <li><strong>5/16:</strong> Nara</li> <li><strong>5/17:</strong> Shinjuku City</li> <li><strong>5/18:</strong> Shinjuku City ‚Äì&gt; Narita Airport, flight</li> </ul> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="prior-to-trip">Prior to Trip</h3> <ul> <li>Make sure your cards are usable abroad.</li> <li>Add the transit cards (Suica, PASMOS, ICOCA) to your Apple Wallet (if you have an Apple device). <ul> <li>Click the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> sign to add a card</li> <li>Click <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Transit Card</code></li> <li>Under the ‚ÄúJapan‚Äù section, click your preferred option (I used Suica)</li> <li>Adding money is through the cards on your Apple Wallet <ul> <li>Make sure you have a Mastercard on there</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Plan your trip in advance, especially places that are a ‚Äúmust-visit‚Äù. <ul> <li>Make reservations for popular restaurants</li> </ul> </li> <li>ZipAir <ul> <li>Read the fine details regarding baggage weights</li> <li>Bring your own food on the flight (it doesn‚Äôt add to your carry-on weight)</li> <li>Have activities ready for the flight (ex: download movies) because there isn‚Äôt an entertainment system provided</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Since you‚Äôre in a foreign country, make sure that you‚Äôll be able to use your cards. Call the bank beforehand and ask them to not block your cards because otherwise, the detectors think there‚Äôs a fraud and then you won‚Äôt be able to use your cards.</p> <p>On your Apple Wallet, make sure that you have a Mastercard on there. Those cards are guaranteed to work to add money to your transportation cards whereas only some Visa cards have proven to work.</p> <blockquote> <p>The transit systems cards in Japan (Suica/PASMOS/ICOCA) are used to pay for the subway stations and buses. Generally, it‚Äôs a physical card but there‚Äôs an IC chip shortage so they aren‚Äôt giving them out to visitors as much (a ‚ÄúWelcome Suica Card‚Äù exists but isn‚Äôt easily available anymore). The card can also be used for purchases too at some stores (in my experience, mainly convenience stores). Get this card instead of buying paper tickets for every ride.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND</strong> planning the majority of your trip in advance, especially factoring in transportation.</p> <ul> <li>What cities do you want to visit? <ul> <li>Book hotels at strategic locations (ex: live in Osaka if you want to visit Kyoto and Nara)</li> </ul> </li> <li>What activities do you want to do/visit? What places do you want to eat at?</li> </ul> <p>I didn‚Äôt plan any of our itinerary until the night before each day so it was really tiring. Additionally, the lack of planning left us unable to see all the places we wanted to visit or try popular restaurants (most require a reservation). Navigating through the public transit system was also a struggle because it‚Äôs hard to initially get a grasp of due to the magnitude and language barrier.</p> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="getting-from-narita-airport-to-tokyo-and-back">Getting from Narita Airport to Tokyo (and back)</h3> <p>All I knew before arriving in Japan was that it‚Äôd take a little over an hour to get from the Narita Airport to our hotel in Tokyo. However, I was clueless and didn‚Äôt think to even consider how to pay for that transportation, let alone what specific type of transportation it would be.</p> <p><u>What I Did:</u></p> <p>After getting our Suica cards set up, we took the train to Tokyo (I think it was the Narita Express) but we just tapped through the scanners and didn‚Äôt buy physical paper tickets. We sat at a random section which ended up being the ‚ÄúReserved Seats‚Äù section ‚Äî this area is checked by the train workers who told us to move to another section (so embarrassing).</p> <p><u>What I Recommend You Do:</u></p> <ul> <li>Search for the most convenient option available (Narita Express tended to be on the more expensive side) <ul> <li>If you have the time and more familarity with the transit system, take the regular subway</li> <li>Narita Express is the most direct option</li> </ul> </li> <li>Narita Express: Each train is split into reserved seating (more expensive) vs. non-reserved seating <ul> <li>Non-reserved seating is at the back of the train, usually cars 1-5</li> <li>It‚Äôll say on the train car and signs which car is reserved seating or not</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>When traveling back to the airport, I decided to take the regular subway system will ended up taking FOREVER for some strange reason (literally took us a little over 3 hours to get from Tokyo to Narita Airport). It was quite traumatic and stressful because we almost missed our flight.</p> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="getting-from-tokyo-to-osaka-and-back">Getting from Tokyo to Osaka (and back)</h3> <p>Traveling from Tokyo to the Osaka area is fairly common and the easiest way is by taking a bullet train (Shinkansen). The ride is a little over 3 hours which is extremely fast considering the amount of miles covered. The train is comfortable and there are bathrooms onboard, as well as (adequate) Wi-Fi.</p> <p>To ride on this train:</p> <ul> <li>Wait in the really long line to get physical tickets with an attendant <ul> <li>Mobile Suica cards don‚Äôt work at the machines because those only accept physical cards</li> </ul> </li> <li>Payment can be through your physical cards like Visa (not Suica)</li> <li>You‚Äôll receive a physical ticket that you‚Äôll insert through the gate (which will be ejected out) in addition to tapping your Suica card against the scanner</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>DO NOT lose your physical ticket. If you do, you‚Äôll need to pay the cost of that ticket again (~$94).</p> </blockquote> <p>I lost my physical ticket near my seat and talked to an attendant at the counter. The company‚Äôs policy is that everyone has to pay the original cost on top of what was previously paid if the workers at both train stations are unable to find your physical ticket.</p> <p>Travelers have the option to pay for ‚Äúreserved‚Äù (more expensive but guaranteed seats) or ‚Äúnon-reserved‚Äù seating. Make sure to pay attention to which train cars are for ‚Äúnon-reserved‚Äù seating ‚Äî typically cars 1-5 at the back.</p> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="cities-visited">Cities Visited</h3> <p>Here are my reviews and reflections for the cities I visited, attractions I saw, and restaurants/food I ate.

We got a bunch of side-eyes since we didn‚Äôt bring umbrellas and didn‚Äôt want to purchase one.</p> <p>The bullet train was a bit of a struggle and after arriving at Shin-Osaka Station, we were famished and chose a random restaurant to eat at. I forgot the name of it but we all ordered this collagen chicken noodle soup. I‚Äôm pretty sure my parents got rizzed up by the word ‚Äúcollagen‚Äù.

Rikuro‚Äôs Namba Main Branch had a huge line outside of it but the wait was very short. The cheesecake was pretty cheap ($8-9) and tasted good, though the 7-11 one might be tastier‚Ä¶ My picture is quite disappointing though because the heat and condensation from the box made the top of the cheesecake flaccid, but luckily it was still a little bit jiggly! <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rating: 8.5/10</code></p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blogs/japan/shinosakafood.JPG-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blogs/japan/shinosakafood.JPG-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blogs/japan/shinosakafood.JPG-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/blogs/japan/shinosakafood.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blogs/japan/cheesecake.JPG-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blogs/japan/cheesecake.JPG-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blogs/japan/cheesecake.JPG-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/blogs/japan/cheesecake.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>We had some difficulty finding our hotel because I was directionally challenged and navigated us to the wrong hotel with a very similar name.

The game was quite lame though, we turned in ~23 plates but only received one prize. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rating: 6/10</code></p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blogs/japan/kurasushi.JPG-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blogs/japan/kurasushi.JPG-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blogs/japan/kurasushi.JPG-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/blogs/japan/kurasushi.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p><br/></p> <h4 id="kyoto">Kyoto</h4> <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 2 days</p> <p><u>Day 1</u></p> <ul> <li>Brunch @ A Happy Pancake Kyoto</li> <li>Nishiki Market</li> <li>Kodaiji Temple, Maruyama Park, Yuzenen Garden</li> <li>Dinner @ Gyukatshu Kyoto Katsugyu - Kyoto Station</li> <li>Uniqlo shopping</li> </ul> <p>Growing up, my family rarely ate out and operated under a very minimalistic lifestyle.

I‚Äôve attempted making Japanese souffl√© pancakes at home which were somewhat of a success, but these were the professional ones that I needed to try. The wait was a little long because of the line and the time the chefs took to make each dish with care. I ordered some matcha brown sugar pancake dish which was really good and just the right quantity because I hit my sugar quota at the end. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rating: 8.5/10</code></p> <p>Nishiki Market is a popular tourist attraction that is essentially a fish market with lots of shops and street food. Since we had just eaten, we didn‚Äôt really buy that many snacks but we did try these mochi strawberries since the strawberries rizzed me up.

Maruyama Park was quite big and we spent a lot of time there because my mom was tired and I needed to find a restaurant to go to for dinner.</p> <p>Gyukatsu Kyoto Katsugyu kept popping up and since my parents have never really tried chicken katsu before, we decided to go there. Turns out, this wasn‚Äôt a chicken katsu place but was instead a wagyu katsu restaurant. My parents hate raw meat so they were really worried but there ended up being a tiny stove where you can cook your meat prior to eating it.

The main priority on the agenda was getting hair cuts since that was what my mom wanted to do the most. I had previously searched online for hair salons and almost all had a reservation/appointment system.</p> <p>Turns out, hair salons prefer customers to schedule appointments (even if it‚Äôs an hour before). We had walked into a salon and they were fully booked, so I found another salon called ‚Äúyoures hair Êñ∞ÂÆøWESTÂ∫ó‚Äù. I hastily made appointments for my mother and I literally an hour before our actual slots.</p> <p>This was the first time I had professional hair treatment in a salon, in addition to dyeing my hair (rip to my hair virginity). Typically, my mom made my aunt or random acquaintances cut my hair on an old and smelly porch in my uncle‚Äôs backyard. I had quite the opposite experience since the salon itself was very clean and sophisticated. My hair was EXTREMELY long since I hadn‚Äôt had a haircut for over a year.</p> <p>Due to the language barrier, I communicated with my hair stylist via Google Translate which honestly wasn‚Äôt too bad. Since I was so inexperienced in the hair world, I literally didn‚Äôt understand some of the phrases he was using and told him to just ‚Äúdo whatever you think is best‚Äù.</p> <p>We had shown up so late in the afternoon (~5 PM) so he informed me that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to get highlights or bleach my hair. I ended up coloring my hair to a darker brown in addition to a hair cut.</p> <p>First, I got my hair slightly wet for the coloring process. Afterwards, he applied the dye onto my hair and I ended up looking like a seran wrap conehead. I had to wait a bit for the dye to color my hair and the salon provided tablets with Amazon Prime and drinks (tea) for their customers to consume. I played some fruit game on my Huawei tablet :D.</p> <p>Once the dye settled onto my hair, my stylist washed my hair and massaged my hair which was a nice experience ‚Äî I almost fell asleep. My initial reaction after seeing my colored hair was that I looked weird. He trimmed my hair but I had to tell him a few times that I wanted to chop off a bunch of inches because I was paying so much money for this. He gave me surface layers and curled my hair at the end.</p> <p>I thought I looked REALLY WEIRD but my parents told me it looked good. In the meantime, my mom got a hair cut and perm which looked great on her.

That part was a little uncomfortable but the udon was really good. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rating: 8.5/10</code></p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blogs/japan/fuunji.JPG-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blogs/japan/fuunji.JPG-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blogs/japan/fuunji.JPG-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/blogs/japan/fuunji.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Afterwards, my parents and I went to several 7-11 stores to buy food for our upcoming flight and search for the coveted 2% low-fat 7/11 milk carton. That was literally the only thing my dad kept raving about ‚Äî how delicious that milk was. We went to four different 7-11‚Äôs and unfortunately exited empty-handed. Perhaps, that milk carton is only available in Tokyo(?) or maybe it is so scrumptious that it sells out quickly‚Ä¶</p> <p>We had planned on spending our last day shopping but the hair appointment took so long that most stores were closed by then. As such, I planned on allocating 1.5 hours to shop before taking the subway to the airport. What a terrible idea‚Ä¶</p> <p>We briefly shopped at a Daiso but I literally could not locate the LOFT store in a mall. That wasted about 20 minutes and by then, it was nearing too close to the time we should depart for the airport. I decided to just navigate us to the airport but the station in Shinjuku City was especially confusing and for some reason, all of the subways we traveled on had random transfers/stops. The ride to the airport took almost four hours when it should have taken a little over one hour‚Ä¶</p> <p>In addition, ZipAir requires passengers to arrive one hour before departure at the latest and we were really close to that deadline. As we were rushing, my mom fell too ;-;</p> <p>All in all, that train ride was extremely stressful because if I had missed my flight, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to go to Seattle the next day since ZipAir flights only operate once a day.</p> <p>Once we arrived at our gate, we wanted to use up the remaining coins we had at an ice cream vending machine. The ice cream bar depicted below was the most expensive one purchased whilst also being the smallest. I shared the bar with my parents since it was the last one but I had completely forgotten that my dad was sick. As a result, I got a sore throat on the flight and ended up falling extremely ill after the flight (in fact, I‚Äôm still sick more than a week later as I‚Äôm writing this).</p> <p>During takeoff, I noticed that the plane‚Äôs wing was a little suspicious and unstable. I‚Äôm no expert on aircraft but that doesn‚Äôt look very safe‚Ä¶ perks of choosing cheap flights! Usually, I welcome death but I had never feared my death as much as I did on that flight because I didn‚Äôt want my parents to pass away.</p> <p>I had read on Reddit that the 7-11 egg salad sandwiches were delicious so obviously, I had to try one myself. I bought one for the flight back but unfortunately, it got squished.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blogs/japan/icecreambar.JPG-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blogs/japan/icecreambar.JPG-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blogs/japan/icecreambar.JPG-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/blogs/japan/icecreambar.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blogs/japan/susplane-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blogs/japan/susplane-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blogs/japan/susplane-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/blogs/japan/susplane.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blogs/japan/eggsalad.JPG-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blogs/japan/eggsalad.JPG-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blogs/japan/eggsalad.JPG-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/blogs/japan/eggsalad.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>During the flight to Japan, I watched ‚ÄúThe Idea of You‚Äù which is a horrible choice when you‚Äôre sitting next to your parents.

Where did they spawn from‚Ä¶</li> <li>People use umbrellas for the smallest amounts of rain. I‚Äôm from California where people freak out over rain and even I think the umbrella usage is ridiculous ‚Äî it was literally for DRIZZLE.</li> <li>Enter the bus through the middle without paying but when leaving, exit through the front entrance after paying via tapping your Suica card.</li> <li>Japan is not very accessibility-friendly. Lugging suitcases across flights of stairs is terrible.</li> </ol> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="tldr">TLDR</h3> <p>Traveling with parents is difficult and don‚Äôt go on a vacation that you haven‚Äôt planned for right after finals and before another trip. Also, don‚Äôt share food with sick people (but the food is FIRE there).</p> <p>Japan has a bit of a ‚Ä¶ stain in my perspective so I‚Äôll be needing some time away from this country.

I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôre here but this post explains why I want to blog.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="so-why">so why?</h2> <p><b></b></p> <p>A lot of people have told me that I‚Äôm a really quiet person and that they want to get to know me better. I‚Äôve also been informed that people want to know what‚Äôs going on in my head. Truth be told, I‚Äôm usually ‚Äúno thoughts, head empty‚Äù. I tend to not overthink things and mainly live (mostly) in the present because life is so unpredictable, something might happen to flip my world upside down so why bother planning every detail?</p> <p>When attempting to make my personal website years ago, I looked at a bunch of other websites for <em>inspiration</em> and I liked the aspect of having a blog/forum of my own opinions and thoughts. I found that section of those sites extremely appealing to read through since it was a way to get to know those people better. Specifically, UC Berkeley‚Äôs <a href="https://cs161.org">CS 161</a> course has a <a href="https://pedagogy.cs161.org/">pedagogy blog</a> that I found <strong>especially</strong> fascinating and thought-provoking. Thus, I wanted a persistent means of sharing my advice or opinions online.</p> <p>Personally, I don‚Äôt think anyone will read any of my posts because I‚Äôm boring but for a long time, I wanted to share a couple of my opinions and have a ‚Äúdiary‚Äù of some sort to see how my thinking has changed and/or transitioned over time. I love data and recording miniscule details so this is another means for that.</p> <p>Medium is another blog forum site which I‚Äôve used before but there are article reading restrictions on that platform, in addition to me not wanting people to get notified when I post which is why I‚Äôm choosing to post on my own site.</p> <p>These opinions will be only affiliated with me and (probably) not edited or proof-read thoroughly, it‚Äôs just a method of me to thought dump and reflect as my life progresses. In actuality, it‚Äôs probably just me wasting my time by procrastinating. Hopefully I‚Äôll be able to post semi-frequently during any downtime I have but we‚Äôll see‚Ä¶ ü§°</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="posts"/><category term="random"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[this post explains why I created a blog]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">KDr-awe-ma Opinions &amp;amp; Recommendations</title><link href="https://christyquang.github.io/blog/2021/kdrama/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="KDr-awe-ma Opinions &amp;amp; Recommendations"/><published>2021-12-09T12:24:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-09T12:24:00+00:00</updated><id>https://christyquang.github.io/blog/2021/kdrama</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://christyquang.github.io/blog/2021/kdrama/"><![CDATA[<p><b></b></p> <p>I‚Äôm too lazy to copy over my original blog post to here so if you want to read it, please click the link below.
