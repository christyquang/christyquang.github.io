This was my first time visiting Japan and the first international trip I‚Äôve taken as a <em>competent</em> human being (aka not a kid).

I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôre here but this post explains why I want to blog.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="so-why">so why?</h2> <p><b></b></p> <p>A lot of people have told me that I‚Äôm a really quiet person and that they want to get to know be better. I‚Äôve also been informed that people want to know what‚Äôs going on in my head. Truth be told, I‚Äôm usually ‚Äúno thoughts, head empty‚Äù. I tend to not overthink things and mainly live (mostly) in the present because life is so unpredictable, something might happen to flip my world upside down so why bother planning every detail?</p> <p>When attempting to make my personal website years ago, I looked at a bunch of other websites for <em>inspiration</em> and I liked the aspect of having a blog/forum of my own opinions and thoughts. I found that section of those sites extremely appealing to read through since it was a way to get to know those people better. Specifically, UC Berkeley‚Äôs <a href="https://cs161.org">CS 161</a> course has a <a href="https://pedagogy.cs161.org/">pedagogy blog</a> that I found <strong>especially</strong> fascinating and thought-provoking. Thus, I wanted a persistent means of sharing my advice or opinions online.</p> <p>Personally, I don‚Äôt think anyone will read any of my posts because I‚Äôm boring but for a long time, I wanted to share a couple of my opinions and have a ‚Äúdiary‚Äù of some sort to see how my thinking has changed and/or transitioned over time. I love data and recording miniscule details so this is another means for that.</p> <p>Medium is another blog forum site which I‚Äôve used before but there are article reading restrictions on that platform, in addition to me not wanting people to get notified when I post which is why I‚Äôm choosing to post on my own site.</p> <p>These opinions will be only affiliated with me and (probably) not edited or proof-read thoroughly, it‚Äôs just a method of me to thought dump and reflect as my life progresses. In actuality, it‚Äôs probably just me wasting my time by procrastinating. Hopefully I‚Äôll be able to post semi-frequently during downtime but we‚Äôll see‚Ä¶ ü§°</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="posts"/><category term="random"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[this post explains why I created a blog]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog</title><link href="https://christyquang.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog"/><published>2022-04-23T23:20:09+00:00</published><updated>2022-04-23T23:20:09+00:00</updated><id>https://christyquang.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://christyquang.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author></entry></feed>
