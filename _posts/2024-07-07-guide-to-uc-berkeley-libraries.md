## um... why?

One of my favorite aspects about UC Berkeley that I take for granted is the number of libraries on campus. It shocked me when I found out that most colleges have only a couple of libraries. If you met me in college, you probably associate rotting in libraries with me since I probably go to a library at least once a day. Surprisingly enough, I never really went to the library to get work done prior to college (which in hindight also makes sense since the libraries were a bit further away from my house and I had no mode of transportation).

I enjoy working in libraries because I‚Äôm able to focus in a location where others are working as well. I call this ‚Äúpeer pressure‚Äù, where knowing the presence of others hard at work motivates me to be productive as well. Additionally, my apartment is further away from campus so it‚Äôs unideal for me to go back and forth from different locations when working, hence why I just go to a library.

As such, my goal is to work in all of the accessible libraries at UC Berkeley by the time I graduate and to provide my opinion on all of them for anyone interested. The number of libraries vary but according to this [article](https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/about/news/library-101), there are 21 libraries (though not all are accessible for undergraduate students). I‚Äôll be ranking them by the criteria below with a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best) with additional comments underneath (ex: needing to show Cal-ID). It‚Äôs difficult to rank which libraries I like best so I‚Äôll notate my preferences on which ones to go to for certain needs.

- Ability to eat
- Ability to find an outlet
- Ability to find a seat
- Crowdedness
- Noise level
- Accessibility (duration of being open)

<br>

#### Art History/Classics Library

- **Eat:** `False`
- **Outlets:** `3/5`
  - A few at one of the entrances
- **Seating:** `3/5`
  - Maybe 4 seats at one of the entrances
- **Crowdedness:** `5/5`
- **Noise:** `4/5`
- **Accessibility:** `1/5`
  - Extremely hidden library, I think I got lost twice trying to find it
- **Comments**

  - This library is for graduate art students so undergrads aren't able to book any rooms. In general though, it's still a very small library

  <br>

#### Bancroft Library

- **Eat:** `False`
  - If you‚Äôre quiet enough and there aren‚Äôt as many ppl, yes
- **Outlets:** `3/5`
  - Desks usually have one
- **Seating:** `3/5`
  - Generally spots available
- **Crowdedness:** `2.5/5`
  - Tends to have tourists to view the architecture of this and Doe Library
  - Busy during exam season
- **Noise:** `3.5/5`
  - Large and tall building so it‚Äôs kind of echoey but people are quiet
- **Accessibility:** `4/5`
  - Opens early and closes around 9 PM throughout weekdays and weekends
- **Comments**
  - Don‚Äôt need Cal-ID to enter
  - Kind of confusing to first navigate since it‚Äôs connected to Doe Library, Main Stacks, and Moffitt

  - Drinks with a lid are allowed but no actual food
- **Outlets:** `4/5`
  - At basically every table
- **Seating:** `3/5`

- **Noise:** `4/5`
  - Graduate students are mature
- **Accessibility:** `2/5`
  - With the restricted access, it's not accessible to all students
  - Also on the highest floor which is a bit of a trek from the front entrance
