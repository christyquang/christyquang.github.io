I'm currently in Japan while I'm drafting this post, unable to sleep because I randomly woke up at 2:30 AM and decided to work on this. This was my first time visiting Japan and the first international trip I've taken as a *competent* human being (aka not a kid). These are the things I wish I knew to make the travel process more seamless and the trip more fun — please don't suffer like I did.

## Essentials

sorry this is a work in progress that i hope to wrap up on my flight, i have to add SO MANY more things

<br>

### Prior to Trip

- idk call the bank and ask them to not block your cards because otherwise, they think there’s a fraud and then you won't be able to use your cards
> Suica card is used for all the transit systems in Japan. Usually it’s a physical card but there’s an IC chip shortage so they aren’t giving them out to visitors as much. There’s a welcome Suica card but also not easily available anymore because of chip shortage. 
- Add Suica (or PASMOS) to your Apple Wallet
  -  Transit
  - You add money thru Apple wallet
  - HAVE A MASTERCARD ON YOUR APPLE WALLET
    - only some Visa cards are accepted but Mastercard is guaranteed (call bank ahead to not block it)
  - The Suica card can be used for purchases too at some stores (mainly the convenience stores in my experience)
  - So much easier to tap in and out of transit systems instead of having to buy paper tickets every time
- lmfao plan your trip in advance
  1. what cities do you want to visit
  2. proceed to book hotels there
  3. search at what activities to do, what places to eat

<br>

### Getting from Narita Airport to Tokyo

- took the train but was boomer so my parents and I sat at the reserved seat section, got checked by the train ppl so we had to move to another section, but it was also reserved seats?
- basically each train is split into reserved (more expensive) vs non reserved seating
  - non reserved seating is at the back of the train, usually cars 1-5 
  - it'll say on the train car and on signs which car is reserved seating or not

<br>

### Getting from Tokyo to Osaka

- took bullet train
- Have to wait in line to get physical tickets
- Don’t accept Suica for some reason (unless I’m incompetent), used Visa card instead

<br>

### My Itinerary

narita --> tokyo (1 day) --> osaka (1 day) --> kyoto (2 days) --> nara (1 day) --> shinjuku/tokyo (1 day) --> narita

### tldr

don't travel with your parents.
