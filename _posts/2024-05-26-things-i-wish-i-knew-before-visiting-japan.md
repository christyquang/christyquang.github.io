**[May 14, 2024]** I'm currently in Japan while I'm drafting this post, unable to sleep because I randomly woke up at 2:30 AM and decided to work on this. This was my first time visiting Japan and the first international trip I've taken as a _competent_ human being (aka not a kid). These are the things I wish I knew to make the travel process more seamless and the trip more fun — please don't suffer like I did.

**[May 26, 2024]** I was bored and don't have friends in Seattle so here I am, writing random nonsense to the void.

### My Itinerary

My dad randomly called me one day in the middle of April saying that he needed to verify some information for filing my taxes, then ended up convincing me to take a week long trip to Japan immediately after my last final until the start of my internship. I truly have never been as stressed as I was during that time period but here are the trip specifications and distance covered:

- **Length:** 5/11/2024 - 5/18/2024
  - Stayed in Tokyo (1 night), Osaka (4 nights), Shinjuku City (1 night)
- **5/11:** Flight
- **5/12:** Narita Airport --> Tokyo
- **5/13:** Osaka
- **5/14:** Kyoto
- **5/15:** Kyoto
- **5/16:** Nara
- **5/17:** Shinjuku City
- **5/18:** Shinjuku City --> Narita Airport, flight

### Prior to Trip

1. Make sure your cards are usable abroad.
2. Add the transit cards (Suica, PASMOS, ICOCA) to your Apple Wallet (if you have an Apple device).
- Click the `+` sign to add a card
- Click `Transit Card`
- Under the "Japan" section, click your preferred option (I used Suica)
- Adding money is through the cards on your Apple Wallet
  - Make sure you have a Mastercard on there
3. Plan your trip in advance, especially places that are a "must-visit".
- Make reservations for popular restaurants
4. ZipAir
- Read the fine details regarding baggage weights
- Bring your own food on the flight (it doesn't add to your carry-on weight)
- Have activities ready for the flight (ex: download movies) because there isn't an entertainment system provided

Since you're in a foreign country, make sure that you'll be able to use your cards. Call the bank beforehand and ask them to not block your cards because otherwise, the detectors think there’s a fraud and then you won't be able to use your cards.

On your Apple Wallet, make sure that you have a Mastercard on there. Those cards are guaranteed to work to add money to your transportation cards whereas only some Visa cards have proven to work.

> The transit systems cards in Japan (Suica/PASMOS/ICOCA) are used to pay for the subway stations and buses. Generally, it’s a physical card but there’s an IC chip shortage so they aren’t giving them out to visitors as much (a "Welcome Suica Card" exists but isn't easily available anymore). The card can also be used for purchases too at some stores (in my experience, mainly convenience stores). Get this card instead of buying paper tickets for every ride.

**HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND** planning the majority of your trip in advance, especially factoring in transportation.

1. What cities do you want to visit?
- Book hotels at strategic locations (ex: live in Osaka if you want to visit Kyoto and Nara)
2. What activities do you want to do/visit? What places do you want to eat at?

I didn't plan any of our itinerary until the night before each day so it was really tiring. Additionally, the lack of planning left us unable to see all the places we wanted to visit or try popular restaurants (most require a reservation). Navigating through the public transit system was also a struggle because it's hard to initially get a grasp of due to the magnitude and language barrier.

### Getting from Narita Airport to Tokyo (and back)

All I knew before arriving in Japan was that it'd take a little over an hour to get from the Narita Airport to our hotel in Tokyo. However, I was clueless and didn't think to even consider how to pay for that transportation, let alone what specific type of transportation it would be.

<u>What I Did:</u>

After getting our Suica cards set up, we took the train to Tokyo (I think it was the Narita Express) but we just tapped through the scanners and didn't buy physical paper tickets. We sat at a random section which ended up being the "Reserved Seats" section — this area is checked by the train workers who told us to move to another section (so embarrassing).

<u>What I Recommend You Do:</u>

- Search for the most convenient option available (Narita Express tended to be on the more expensive side)
  - If you have the time and more familarity with the transit system, take the regular subway
  - Narita Express is the most direct option
- Narita Express: Each train is split into reserved seating (more expensive) vs. non-reserved seating
  - Non-reserved seating is at the back of the train, usually cars 1-5
  - It'll say on the train car and signs which car is reserved seating or not

When traveling back to the airport, I decided to take the regular subway system will ended up taking FOREVER for some strange reason (literally took us a little over 3 hours to get from Tokyo to Narita Airport). It was quite traumatic and stressful because we almost missed our flight.

### Getting from Tokyo to Osaka (and back)

Traveling from Tokyo to the Osaka area is fairly common and the easiest way is by taking a bullet train (Shinkansen). The ride is a little over 3 hours which is extremely fast considering the amount of miles covered. The train is comfortable and there are bathrooms onboard, as well as (adequate) Wi-Fi.

To ride on this train:

- Wait in the really long line to get physical tickets with an attendant
  - Mobile Suica cards don't work at the machines because those only accept physical cards
- Payment can be through your physical cards like Visa (not Suica)
- You'll receive a physical ticket that you'll insert through the gate (which will be ejected out) in addition to tapping your Suica card against the scanner

> DO NOT lose your physical ticket. If you do, you'll need to pay the cost of that ticket again (~$94).

I lost my physical ticket near my seat and talked to an attendant at the counter. The company's policy is that everyone has to pay the original cost on top of what was previously paid if the workers at both train stations are unable to find your physical ticket.

Travelers have the option to pay for "reserved" (more expensive but guaranteed seats) or "non-reserved" seating. Make sure to pay attention to which train cars are for "non-reserved" seating — typically cars 1-5 at the back.

### Takeaways

1. The public transportation system there is SO GOOD but also simultaneously so overwhelming.
2. Everything in Japan is so cheap compared to the USA. Travel LIGHT, you'll want to buy stuff (in fact, do because the yen has depreciated so much).
3. Food is infinitely better in Japan. 7/11 is FANTASTIC.
4. Society is kind of "old" but technology (especially transportation) is strangely advanced?
5. Why are there SO MANY PEOPLE at the subway stations and everywhere in general? Where did they spawn from...
6. People use umbrellas for the smallest amounts of rain. I'm from California where people freak out over rain and even I think the umbrella usage is ridiculous — it was literally for DRIZZLE.
7. Enter the bus through the middle without paying but when leaving, exit through the front entrance after paying via tapping your Suica card.
8. Japan is not very accessibility-friendly. Lugging suitcases across flights of stairs is terrible.

### TLDR

Traveling with parents is difficult and don't go on a vacation where you haven't planned for right after finals and before another trip.
