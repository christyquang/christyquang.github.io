I don't know why I'm posting this to the Internet - I hope no one reads this. It's also written terribly, I'm sorry.

## thoughts

To anyone reading this, this is not meant to be a sob story or an attempt to make people feel bad for me. I’m very grateful for my life and the people in it. I don’t even know why I’m posting this to be honest, another calling to the void…

I’m currently in Seattle for the summer, a city known for depression and sadness because of the constant rain. I also spent last summer here because of an internship. Prior to interning, I had this hope of making a close knit group of friends for the summer, having the time of our lives. This “dream” is probably because of a few older friends I have who developed a close group of friends while interning.

Simply put, I never had friends until college. Sure, I had one or two here and there (I’m not trying to disregard those friendships). I guess a better term is “friend group” but that’s also not the point I’m trying to make.

Starting off with a few of my earliest memories, I only recall having one or two friends every year in elementary school. In the American education system, students in elementary school are assigned to a classroom for the year with the same group of students (~26). The following year, students would typically move up a grade and be reassigned teachers, thus causing classmates to change. I vividly recall numerous parent-teacher conferences where feedback from my teachers would always be that I’m very quiet.

As a result, I mostly kept to myself and with the few friends I had, I would end up losing them to the new friends they made. I always dreaded recess because I never had friends to play with. During the earlier years, I played by myself at the play structure with the monkey bars. This transitioned to a brief wall-ball stint where I would later on walk aimlessly around the school yard. Eventually, I would hide at the very back of the school perimeter or walk to the farthest field and just sit in the grass. Thank goodness students were forced to sit with their class during lunch…
In middle school, there was free seating though so I always sat at this table with an acquaintance (my stand partner from orchestra) who I guess took pity on me. I would just eat my lunch in silence while the people around me talked, then leave for the rest of that time.

As someone who is quiet, I would people-watch often and all I ever wanted was a group of friends. It was always my biggest worry for large events such as field trips, promotion/graduation, or even just the break period before performing in a concert. With the few people I knew, they would converse with me but eventually, they would leave and go to their actual friends. In 8th grade, we had an overnight trip to Disneyland which was the highlight of orchestra/band but I was constantly worried about what group I’d be part of throughout the day when going on rides. I desperately envied a few friend groups who seemed extremely close, and was just afraid of appearing lonely. Thankfully, my cousin changed schools and joined mine in 7th grade. We grew up together so it was great having a familiar face nearby.

I attended a very large high school (~830 students per grade level) and there were various “break” periods throughout the day. During brunch (15 min), I would rotate between:

1. Going to the library and pretending to browse the books or quickly finish homework
2. Going to the bathroom to pee/hide in the stall when I actually didn’t need to go
3. Walk to my building, go to my locker, then pretend I’m searching or grabbing something in my locker when in actuality, it’s empty

15 minutes is such a short amount of time but it was extremely dreaded for me. I absolutely hated going to my class building because everyone would be clustered around in their friend groups, but I had none to go to. I would arrive to school exactly on time to avoid having to spend time near peers waiting for school to start. I absolutely hated rainy days because everyone would be gathered in the buildings with their friends but I didn’t have a location to go to.

During lunch, I would sit outside on the ground near a pillar and eat with my cousin. Honestly, I don’t know why she even chose to eat with me. She had more friends than me and an actual group to go to as well so I think she just felt pitiful of me. I’m appreciative of it throughout all the years though — I was really pathetic.

An unpopular opinion but I was appreciative of COVID-19 though because it took away a lot of my worries regarding friendships. All of the senior events that were canceled now left me less stressed since I didn’t have to worry about being friendless. With college, I wanted to change myself and actually make friends. During orientation, I went out of my comfort zone to attend events and converse with people, but I never vibed with anybody except for two people who probably invited me because we were females in STEM.

In retrospect, I don’t think I realized how lonely I was in elementary school until probably fifth grade. _I thought I was pretty normal so what was wrong with me?_ Yeah, I know I’m introverted but this was a little strange, especially after changing myself in college. The loneliness in college is fine for the most part — everyone is so busy and schedules are so different that it’s hard to meet up. I’ve also found clubs where I’ve gratefully made friends from.

I’ve always had these worries and fears about myself but they came to life in Summer 2023 when I was generally alone. My internship was my first “real” job but my team was fully remote, so I had no one to eat lunch with. Additionally, the people on my floor became friends earlier than I did because I had to fly back home for several graduations during the first two weekends, leaving them to be more closely bonded. As a result, I wasn’t part of their friend group and ended up eating lunch alone (genuinely every day) by hiding in one of the nooks.

Luckily, one of my Berkeley friends was in Seattle and she made two other friends during tech setup. So in total, I had three other friends throughout the entirety of summer. I’m extremely grateful for them since we had similar interests (ex: hiking) but in the grand scheme, Amazon had about 9,000-15,000 interns in the Seattle area alone, and I was only able to become friends with two of them? And they weren’t even people I met by myself, they were through my Berkeley friend. What was so offputting about me?

With all of the time I had by myself, I ended up spending a lot of time thinking about myself, my life, and the world. That’s another topic maybe for later but I cried a lot these past two summers which is a lot for me.

This summer at work, I'm privileged enough where most meals are provided by the office so most interns eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner there. However, my manager is full-time remote and my mentors were gone for the first couple of weeks, leaving me alone for the majority of the work day. It’s not that bad, but the other interns around me were constantly included in their team and I just felt very alone. _Why couldn’t I get the same experience they did?_

To this date (starting Week 5/12), I have yet to eat lunch or dinner with the other interns. I’m sure they’d be okay with me joining them, but it feels a little weird since I’m just butting into their group. Nobody has ever reached out to eat with me and it just makes me think about whether my existence matters or not. I know I’m being dramatic but it’s a thought that constantly circles in my head. I’m fairly certain that if I ended up dying, no one would know about it until at least a week later and nobody would be affected by it except for a few select people (my parents).

_Oh, why not just be the person who invites others to do activities with you?_ I think that because it's so rare that I get invited to anything, _why would anyone want to hang out with me?_ To cope with this, I've adjusted with doing activities by myself which I enjoy, but it does get lonely and a bit embarrassing that everyone is with at least another person while I'm just by myself. And for some activities like hiking, it's really hard to conduct solo (and unsafe) but hopefully when I go hiking alone, I’ll get lost with my phone dead, unreachable.

This has just become a ramble but all in all, I’ve just felt extremely lonely over the past few weeks more than usual. There’s nothing that can be done to change this so I’ve just accepted the fact that I’ll be doing things independently like I’ve always done for the rest of my time in Seattle and beyond.

I’ve been told by many Berkeley people that I’m a really good friend. It’s not intentional but I guess it’s because I have so few that I truly treasure the ones I have. People might appear to be okay on the outside but that’s not always the case — the thoughts are consuming.
