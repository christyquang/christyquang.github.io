## granola girl backstory

Iâ€™ve never been on a hike until I was 20 years old. During my first summer in Seattle, I went on a few hikes because my friends wanted to and I followed along because I didnâ€™t want to be a party pooper. I discovered that there are a bunch of perks with hiking since Iâ€™m able to exercise my endurance and body while not having to do my least favorite sport â€“ run. Additionally, I enjoy working hard for an outcome which is esentially what hiking entails. Hikers have to battle through the hike in order to (typically) reach the goal: the view.

During my second summer in Seattle, my objective was to go on a hike every weekend since Washingtonâ€™s nature is beautiful and more accessible than the hikes in California. I also needed some sort of consistent exercise with all of the free food I was getting ðŸ’€. Admittedly, Iâ€™ve become a granola girl and have bought a pair of hiking boots, a hiking backpack, trail mix, forest day passes, and rented some cars to just go hiking during Summer 2024. My next purchase will probably be a pair of hiking poles or a REI subscription ðŸ’€.

Iâ€™m by no means an experienced hiker which is why I think itâ€™d be nice to have reviews from someone who started hiking with no experience and also isnâ€™t an incredibly fit athlete (introduces bias) either LOL. I also didnâ€™t have a car during both summers so I wanted to share hikes I was able to go on without a car. Lastly, Iâ€™ve been asked by many people which

In this article, Iâ€™ll be listing the trail I went on, the length of the trail, difficulty, key details, and a summary of my hike. During Summer 2023, I lived in Capitol Hill and the UW area whereas in Summer 2024, I lived in Capitol Hill so transportation will be based off of those areas.

# All Hikes I've Been On

### Mount Teneriffe Falls `*`

- **Trail:** [Teneriffe Falls Loop via the Mount Teneiffe Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/ar/trail/us/washington/teneriffe-falls-loop-via-the-mount-teneriffe-trail)
- **Length:** 5.9 mi
- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Key Details:**
  - Extremely rocky nearing the top, would recommend hiking poles and hiking boots
  - The peak/view is just the waterfall, kind of lame considering how hard the hike was
  - Bathrooms are gross but thatâ€™s to be expected
- **Summary:**
  - In hindsight, honestly cannot believe this was my first hike in Washington â€” kind of impressive considering the turn of events and how I almost died on this hike (read more here once I write this post lol)
  - My friends and I brought alcoholic beverages (White Claws) and a coconut to share at the top

- **Summary:**
  - Impulsively paraglided the hike down because the people offered my friend and I a discount LOL

- **Length:** 5.4 mi
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Key Details:**
  - Not public transit friendly - there are two busses that drop you off near the trailhead but they come very infrequently (once every hour)
  - Beach is pretty lame and not accessible (can basically only enter to one section and you canâ€™t spread out across the shore)
  - Next to Bastyr University

- **Length:** 6.51 mi
- **Difficulty:** Moderate (persnally thought it was moderate-hard)

### Mount Si `*`

- **Trail:** [Mount Si Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/ar/trail/us/washington/mount-si-trail)
- **Length:** 8.13 mi
- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Key Details:**
  - Relatively popular trail (apparently most Washington residents go on this hike at least once) among adults
  - Very rocky at the top, would recommend hiking poles and hiking boots
  - So many bugs and mosquitos, would recommend bug spray because stopping meant bugs swarming you
  - Bathrooms are gross but thatâ€™s to be expected
- **Summary:**
  - I got 12 bug bites after this hike while wearing long pants
  - My hip hurt to the point where putting on pants and socks was extremely uncomfortable after this hike (but I also hiked Squak Mountain the day before)

### Colchuck Lake

- **Trail:** [Colchuck Lake via Stuart Lake and Colchuck Lake Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/ar/trail/us/washington/colchuck-lake-via-stuart-lake-trail)
- **Length:** 10.51 mi
- **Difficulty:** Hard (personally thought moderate-hard)
- **Key Details:**
  - Drove a rental car to this hike: commute is ~3 hour drive from SeaTac to the trailhead parking
  - Very uneven terrain to get to the parking area (would not bring my own car to this) and had to park 1 mile away from the trailhead
  - Requires a parking pass ($5 per day)
  - Extremely popular hike among all age groups
  - Alpine lake at the peak of the hike, still snow in some areas in mid August
  - Extremely rocky at the top, would recommend hiking poles and hiking boots
  - So many bugs and mosquitos, would recommend bug spray because stopping meant bugs swarming you
  - Bathrooms are gross but thatâ€™s to be expected
- **Summary:**
  - I had a lot of hype surrounding this hike and it was kind of disappointing. The hike overall was easier than Mount Si in terms of elevation but the length of the hike was more than its utility. Getting to the lake is difficult (scramble through rocky areas) and the water didnâ€™t look too clean so I didnâ€™t swim in it.
  - I had a headache at the peak and all I wanted to do was go home but since the hike is so long, I had to hike 5 miles back and drive for another 3 hours.

# No Car Hikes

The parks in Washington are absolutely beautiful and larger than the suburban parks Iâ€™m used to which is why most have trails. I needed to also ease myself back into hiking which is why I went to a bunch of parks since they serve as good alternatives to more strenuous hiking trails.

I didnâ€™t have a car in Seattle but luckily, Washington has significantly better public transportation than California. Especially with all of the nature, there is the [Trailhead Direct](https://trailheaddirect.org/) which operates during the weekends between late May till mid September. This is just an extension of the King County Metro where there are shuttles that drop riders off to some trailheads. Payment is through the ORCA card ($2.75 per ride) which I think is a great deal since the shuttles are relatively fast and you donâ€™t have to drive after a tiring hike. The only downside is that the shuttles do get full fast so be sure to get there early and that the timings of the bus is inconsistent (but they do eventually come).

During my second summer here, I had no friends but I still wanted to hike. Itâ€™s definitely a lot more riskier and cost-inefficient for solo hikers so I had to adapt and research hiking trails that were public transit-friendly. It was a bit difficult to find which trails were accessible so I wanted to compile a list for people who were in the same boat as me.

- Seward Park
- Carkeek Park
- Washington Park Arboretum
- Discovery Park
- Bridle Trails State Park
- Saint Edward State Park
- Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park
- Squak Mountain
- Mount Teneriffe Falls
- Little Si
- Mount Si
