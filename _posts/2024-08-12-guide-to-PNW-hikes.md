## granola girl backstory

Iâ€™ve never been on a hike until I was 20 years old. During my first summer in Seattle, I went on a few hikes because my friends wanted to and I followed along because I didnâ€™t want to be a party pooper. I discovered that there are a bunch of perks with hiking since Iâ€™m able to exercise my endurance and body while not having to do my least favorite sport â€“ run. Additionally, I enjoy working hard for a goal/outcome which is esentially what hiking entails. Hikers have to battle through the hike in order to (typically) reach the goal: the view. 

During my second summer in Seattle, my goal was to go on a hike every weekend since Washingtonâ€™s nature is beautiful and more accessible than the hikes in California. Admittedly, Iâ€™ve become a granola girl and have bought a pair of hiking boots, a hiking backpack, trail mix, forest day passes, and rented some cars to just go hiking during Summer 2024. My next purchase will probably be a pair of hiking poles or a REI subscription ðŸ’€.

Iâ€™m by no means an experienced hiker which is why I think itâ€™d be nice to have reviews from someone who started hiking with no experience and also isnâ€™t an incredibly fit athlete (introduces bias) either LOL. I also didnâ€™t have a car during both summers so I wanted to share hikes I was able to go on without a car. Lastly, Iâ€™ve been asked by many people which

In this article, Iâ€™ll be listing the trail I went on, the length of the trail, the difficulty listed on AllTrails, my own personal rating of the trail, key details, and a summary of my hike. During Summer 2023, I lived in Capitol Hill and the UW area whereas in Summer 2024, I lived in Capitol Hill so transportation will be based off of those areas.

  - So many bugs and mosquitos, would recommend bug spray because stopping meant bugs swarming you
  - Bathrooms are gross but thatâ€™s to be expected
- Summary:
  - I got 12 bug bites after this hike while wearing long pants

  - Extremely rocky at the top, would recommend hiking poles and hiking boots
  - So many bugs and mosquitos, would recommend bug spray because stopping meant bugs swarming you
  - Bathrooms are gross but thatâ€™s to be expected
- Summary:
  - I had a lot of hype surrounding this hike and it was kind of disappointing. The hike overall was easier than Mount Si in terms of elevation but the length of the hike was more than its utility. Getting to the lake is difficult (scramble through rocky areas) and the water didnâ€™t look too clean so I didnâ€™t swim in it.
  - I had a headache at the peak and all I wanted to do was go home but since the hike is so long, I had to hike 5 miles back and drive for another 3 hours.

# No Car Hikes

The parks in Washington are absolutely beautiful and larger than the suburban parks Iâ€™m used to which is why most have trails. I needed to also ease myself back into hiking which is why I went to a bunch of parks since they serve as good alternatives to more strenuous hiking trails.

I didnâ€™t have a car in Seattle but luckily, Washington has significantly better public transportation than California. Especially with all of the nature, there is the [Trailhead Direct](https://trailheaddirect.org/) which operates during the weekends between late May till mid September. This is just an extension of the King County Metro where there are shuttles that drop riders off to some trailheads. Payment is through the ORCA card ($2.75 per ride) which I think is a great deal since the shuttles are relatively fast and you donâ€™t have to drive after a tiring hike. The only downside is that the shuttles do get full fast so be sure to get there early and that the timings of the bus is inconsistent (but they do eventually come).

During my second summer here, I had no friends but I still wanted to hike. Itâ€™s definitely a lot more riskier and cost-inefficient for solo hikers so I had to adapt and research hiking trails that were public transit-friendly. It was a bit difficult to find which trails were accessible so I wanted to compile a list for people who were in the same boat as me.

- Seward Park
- Carkeek Park
- Washington Park Arboretum
- Discovery Park
- Bridle Trails State Park
- Saint Edward State Park
- Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park
- Squak Mountain
- Mount Teneriffe Falls
- Little Si
- Mount Si

- Lake 22
- Little Si
- Discovery Park
- Honorable mention: Golden Gardens Park (the only beach with sand Iâ€™ve found)
