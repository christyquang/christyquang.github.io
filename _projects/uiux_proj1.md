This was the final project for _ME110: Introduction to Product Development_ where my group created a skincare app that leverages AI and user data to provide tailored skincare support.

I served as one of two project leaders, enabling our group to fulfill entire product development lifecycle (patent search, competitor and user interview analysis, concept selection method/business model, prototype creation, showcase, final report). Below is our final report and other documentation created is listed below.
