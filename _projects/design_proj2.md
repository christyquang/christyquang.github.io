I wanted to make graduation gifts for my friends since literally all of my close friends are part of Class of 2024. Since we all love Berkeley, this gift needed to resemble some aspect of Berkeley and the Campanile is one of its most iconic landmarks.

With everyone moving onwards toward their graduated lives, this meant moving into a new place and needing to buy furniture. Pot coasters are used pretty frequently for those who cook so it seemed like a practical gift idea. I'm a terrible artist so instead, I traced this viewpoint of Berkeley on Adobe Illustrator and engraved it onto a circular piece of plywood. This way, my friends will think of Berkeley when using this pot coaster.

I was also told that it's too pretty to use so it can also be a pretty piece of wood and part of room decor LOL. go bears üß∏ for real
