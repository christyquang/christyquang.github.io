For the final project in DESINV 22, we had to make a bluetooth controlled vehicle that would be tested against the obstacle course during our showcase day. This entailed coming up with a design for the vehicle's wheels and body that would be able to withstand the unknown obstacles during demo day.

Our vehicle ended up reaching the finish line (barely) but there are definitely improvements that could be made to our bluetooth vehicle.

Below is my more detailed write up for this project where I go through the materials used, the build process, etc. Here is also the link to:
