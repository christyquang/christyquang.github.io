One of my friends is the biggest Tesla superfan so as a graduation + birthday gift, I designed and 3D printed a model of a Tesla Supercharger which is intended to be used as a phone charger holder. I saw the design online and replicated it which was actually pretty difficult to do. It's definitely very extra and more time consuming to use than a normal phone charger but at least it matches with my friend's Hot Wheels Tesla Model Y car!
