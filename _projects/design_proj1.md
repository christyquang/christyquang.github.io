I wanted to make gifts for my friends with my newly acquired laser cutting skills but I didn't know what to make. I'm a practical gift giver where I want to give people something that they'll actually utilize in the future. I stumbled across the concept of a "perpetual calendar" where you're able to view any year, month, or day in the Gregorian calendar.

My mind was absolutely blown that something like this could exist lol so I knew I had to make it. Ironically enough, I only have my prototype version for myself but hopefully when I have enough time, I'll be able to make myself one. I also need to take better process and product photos for this alongside add a more detailed writeup so that'll be more tasks in the backlog.

I've created wooden and acrylic versions of this calendar with personalized names and icons for the calendar header. After a lot of refinement, I'm pretty satisfied with this design ‚Äî maybe I'll create an Etsy shop in the future and take orders once I get my own laser cutter üòµ‚Äçüí´.
