One of my class projects was to make a sound machine which essentially means "make anything that is able to produce some type of noise". Since I had already made another [sound machine](https://christyquang.github.io/projects/desinv22_proj1/) in DESINV 22 that focused more on prototyping/linear motion, I wanted this project to emphasize more on the electronics side. I value laughter so I wanted my machine to embody any sort of humorical aspect. As such, I thought of creating a fart machine: a contraption and prank device that produces fart noises.

Embarrassingly enough, I spent way too much time and effort on this project. However, it has definitely been my most favorite build so far...

Below is my more detailed write up for this project where I go through the materials used, the build process, etc. Here are also links to:
