One of my class projects was to make a sound machine which essentially means "make anything that is able to produce some type of noise". This was the first sound machine I made which focused more on prototyping/linear motion (check out my second sound machine [here](https://christyquang.github.io/projects/desinv23_proj2/)).

I always considered marble machines as really cool contraptions and wanted to attempt recreating it. During this time, this was the middle of my first recruiting season so it was a topic constantly on my mind. As a result, this project is semi-inspired by that where the coins represent having a job and the marbles slowly ascending then clinking down in a loop represent the continuous hopeful-then-dismaying loop students have when going through the recruitment process.

Below is my more detailed write up for this project where I go through the materials used, the build process, etc. Here is also the link to:
