This was a group project for _DESINV 25: User Experience Design_ where we were tasked to perform a critique of an existing experience, identify areas for improvement, then redesign the experience using the principles of visual and user experience design.

We chose to critique the app [Snackpass](https://www.snackpass.co/) since it's used by all of us pretty frequently. Specifically, we revamped the Discovery, Select, Join Party & Order, and Friends sections to address user critques and enable greater functionality.

Below are slides showcasing our redesign and other documentation created is listed below.
