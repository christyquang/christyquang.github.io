This was a group project for _DESINV 25: User Experience Design_ where my group wireframed a prototype of our app, _Sprout_. This project focused on harnessing the power of social entrepreneurship and leveraging design principles to create a product that addresses a pressing social or environmental issue. We conducted user research, empathized with the target audience, and developed a medium-high fidelity prototype that showcases our innovative solution.

_Sprout_ is a personalized learning platform for anyone to better themselves to better the world, using AI technology to consolidate customized multimodel content for learning pathways in various topics (world issues, technology, environmental/sustainability, equality, etc). There is an emphasis on gamification to entice users (primarily teenagers/young adults) to learn since they'll be leaders in the future.

Below is an infographic showcasing _Sprout_ and other documentation created is listed below.
