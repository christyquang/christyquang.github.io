    splat, the mark making machine
</div>

One of my class projects was to make a mark making machine which essentially means "make anything that is able to produce some type of mark on a surface". It was extremely difficult for me to come up with what to create and I was idealess for a long period of time. After staring at a tiny motor, I thought of creating a "paint splatter" effect with that and a piece of string. It eventually ended up looking like a noose with a failed "paint splatter" effect which is kind of what the message of the project is.

Below is my more detailed write up for this project where I go through the materials used, the build process, etc. Here are also links to:
