One of my class projects was to make a machine that encompasses "linear to rotary motion". What this essentially means is "make anything that requires user interaction but causes something to move".

As the first "big" project in DESINV 22, I had no clue what to make, let alone have any ideas for what motion I wanted to create. We had just learned how to laser cut designs in class and I was embarrassingly pretty associated with the game "_Among Us_" at the time which is why I thought it'd be hilarious to laser cut an Among Us character recreate it "venting".

Below is my more detailed write up for this project where I go through the materials used, the build process, etc. Here is also the link to:
