Hello! I'm Christy, a fourth-year undergraduate majoring in Computer Science and Data Science at UC Berkeley. Iâ€™m interested in the intersection of software development and product design/human-centered interaction.

In my free time, I love playing sports (anything but running), watching basketball (Warriors!), hiking, baking/cooking, and reading.

Feel free to reach out to <a href="mailto:christyquang@berkeley.edu">christyquang@berkeley.edu</a> if you'd like to chat!
